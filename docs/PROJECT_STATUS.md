# Salu-Salo — Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-09-25 (Phase 4 in progress, §8). Based on the code at commit `d4f65fe` on `master`, plus the image changes described in §3.2 and §3.3 and the load-failure fixes in §3.4, which were committed together with this document on 2026-09-25. Manual test results reported on 2026-09-25 are in the [results log](#results-log)._

This is the handoff status document. It was first written from static inspection of the Kotlin code and the Supabase SQL at `d4f65fe`, plus build checks (see [Build verification](#build-verification)). Manual results are recorded only as reported by the tester. Keep it up to date, and never mark an item fixed or tested unless it actually was.

**Legend**
- **Implemented (code):** present in the code at `d4f65fe`, confirmed by reading it.
- **Manually tested:** a recorded run on a device or emulator, listed in the [results log](#results-log). The first results were reported on 2026-09-25; anything not listed there is still unverified.
- **Not yet verified:** not confirmed by a build, a manual run, or both.

Unless stated otherwise, Kotlin paths are relative to `app/src/main/java/com/example/salusalo/`. Line numbers (`L…`) refer to `d4f65fe` and will drift as code changes.

## 1. Project status

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1: Backend Foundation | Firebase email/password auth, Supabase client using Firebase tokens, `users` profiles, private Storage buckets | **Complete.** Do not redo. Authentication/profile regression passed on 2026-09-25 ([results log](#results-log)). |
| Phase 2: Food Listings | `food_posts`, create listing with image upload to `food-images`, feed, My Listings, delete | **Complete.** Do not redo. Regression passed on 2026-09-25 for both accounts: Home/feed, create listing, delete listing ([results log](#results-log)). |
| Phase 3: Reservations | Reserve, cancel and claim with atomic quantity; recipient and donor views | **Complete.** Signed off by the developer on 2026-09-25. The A/B reservation test, the missing-image fallback/feed check, and the cancel, claim and Recommended for You tests passed; the remaining checks without an individual test record are listed under the [results log](#results-log). The changes since `d4f65fe` were committed on 2026-09-25 (§6). |
| Phase 4: Messaging and Notifications | Chat per listing (recipient ↔ donor), in-app alerts for messages and reservation changes, live updates through Supabase Realtime, notification preferences stored in Supabase (§8) | **In progress: implemented in code on 2026-09-25, not built with AGP, migration not applied, not tested on a device.** The SQL was run and tested on a local Postgres 16; the Kotlin was type-checked (§8.6). |
| Phase 5: Maps, Reviews, Reports | Known only by its roadmap title; not yet specified in the repo | **Not started.** |
| Phase 6: Admin and Final Release | Known only by its roadmap title; not yet specified in the repo | **Not started.** |

- The roadmap has six phases (confirmed by the developer on 2026-09-25); earlier versions of this document went only up to Phase 4. Phases 1–3 are described in §1–§3 and Phase 4 in §8.

### Build verification

- **Result:** `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.
  - Run on 2026-09-25 01:37 (+08:00), during this documentation pass.
  - Command: `gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug --offline`, with `JAVA_HOME` set to the Gradle-provisioned JDK 21.
  - `compileDebugKotlin` was already up to date, which means the current sources had already compiled in an earlier IDE build. Manifest, resources, dex and packaging re-ran.
  - No unit tests, instrumented tests or lint were run.
- **After the §3.2 and §3.3 image changes:** `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 47s` on 2026-09-25, same command.
  - `compileDebugKotlin` re-ran, so the changed sources compiled.
  - The only compiler warning, a deprecated `Icons.Outlined.ArrowBack` in `MainActivity.kt`, was already present at `d4f65fe`.
  - No tests or lint were run, and the app was not installed or run.
- **After the §3.4 load-failure fixes:** `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 16s` on 2026-09-25, same command.
  - `compileDebugKotlin` re-ran. Its only warning, a deprecated `Icons.Outlined.FormatListBulleted` in `ActivityScreen.kt`, was already present at `d4f65fe`; it appears because that file was recompiled.
  - No tests or lint were run, and the app was not installed or run.
- **Automated tests:** only the Android Studio templates `ExampleUnitTest` and `ExampleInstrumentedTest` exist.

### Phase 1: what exists (summary)

- **Auth flows.** Sign-up (with display name), sign-in, password-reset email and sign-out through Firebase, in `SaluSaloApp()` (`MainActivity.kt` L113–325).
  - An existing session is restored on launch (`LaunchedEffect(firebaseAuth.currentUser?.uid)`, L156–160).
  - System Back on the Home page signs the user out (L162–171).
- **Profile creation.** After sign-up the ID token is force-refreshed so it includes the `role: authenticated` claim, which a Cloud Function adds outside this repo. `UserRepository.loadOrCreateCurrentProfile()` then finds or creates the `public.users` row.
  - New rows are always `RECIPIENT`: the DB default plus the RLS insert check.
- **Supabase tokens.** `SupabaseClientProvider` sends the Firebase ID token to Supabase, and RLS checks it via `is_salusalo_firebase_jwt()`.
- **Storage.** The private buckets `food-images` and `profile-images` are created by `20260921_phase1_foundation.sql`.
- **Not part of the implemented scope** (current placeholders):
  - The Google, Apple and Facebook buttons only show a message.
  - "Keep me signed in" has no effect.
  - Profile name/location edits, the profile photo and settings are saved only to local SharedPreferences. Reviews are sample data.
  - Only the displayed profile **name** comes from Supabase.
  - `StorageRepository.profileImagePath()` is unused.

### Phase 2: what exists (summary)

- **Create listing.** `FoodRepository.createFoodPost()` uploads the image to `food-images/<firebaseUid>/<postId>/image.<ext>` with `upsert = false`, then inserts the `food_posts` row with `image_url = <storage path>`. If the insert fails, the uploaded image is deleted.
- **Feed.** `getAvailableFoodPosts()` returns posts with `status = AVAILABLE` and `expiration_date > now`.
  - Each post gets a 1-hour signed URL in `displayImageUrl`.
  - The Home list (`AvailableFoodCard`) shows it with `AsyncImage`.
- **Own posts.** `getUserFoodPosts()` feeds PostScreen → "My posts" and Activity → My Listings, both with Delete. Delete removes the row, then the image.
- **Not part of the implemented scope:**
  - **No edit UI.** `FoodRepository.updateFoodPost()` exists but is unused.
  - **Only the first selected photo is uploaded**, even though up to four can be picked.
  - **Form fields that are collected but not saved:** price ("I want to sell"), pickup start/end, distribution mode, partial claims and maximum per recipient, allergens, storage notes.
  - **Hard-coded display values:** every listing shows "Free", provider "Food donor", rating "New", and uses a fixed distance of 0 for the "Nearby" filter.

## 2. Phase 3 — Reservations: actual implementation

Code involved:
- `supabase/migrations/20260924_phase3_reservations.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20260924_phase3_donor_recipient_names.sql`
- `data/ReservationRepository.kt`
- `model/Reservation.kt`
- `viewmodel/ReservationViewModel.kt`
- UI: `FoodDetailsScreen` in `MainActivity.kt`, and `ActivityScreen.kt`

### 2.1 Data model

- **`public.reservations` table.**
  - `id` (uuid).
  - `food_post_id` → `food_posts.id`, **on delete cascade**.
  - `recipient_id` → `users.id`, on delete restrict.
  - `quantity`, which must be > 0.
  - `status`: `RESERVED`, `CLAIMED` or `CANCELLED` (default `RESERVED`).
  - `created_at` and `updated_at` (kept current by a trigger).
  - Indexes on `recipient_id` and `food_post_id`.
- **Kotlin (`model/Reservation.kt`).**
  - `Reservation` and `ReservationStatus` mirror the table.
  - `ReservationDisplay(reservation, foodPost, recipientName?)` is the row the UI renders.
  - `DonorReservationRow` holds the `get_donor_reservations()` result, including `recipient_name`.

### 2.2 Creating reservations

- **UI.** `FoodDetailsScreen` (`MainActivity.kt` L2228) opens from any feed or recommendation card.
  - **Reserve** (L2700–2714) calls `reservationViewModel.reserve(food.id, quantity)`.
  - On the user's own post (`isOwnFood`, L1958) it shows "You cannot reserve your own food post." instead.
- **Call chain.** `ReservationViewModel.reserve()` → `ReservationRepository.createReservation()` → RPC `create_reservation(p_food_post_id, p_quantity)`. Only the post ID and quantity are sent; the recipient is derived from the JWT.
- **On success.**
  - The message "Reservation created. Please coordinate pickup with the donor." is set.
  - `myReservations` is reloaded.
  - `FoodDetailsScreen` calls `onReserved()`, which reloads the feed and closes the dialog (L1960–1963, L2279–2287).
- **On failure.** The raw exception message is shown in a "Reservation" dialog.
- **Not a reservation.** "Claim Now" / "Buy Now" on the same screen opens `FoodActionsDialog` (`FoodActions.kt`). That flow is **preview-only**; it states "No request was sent, no stock was held, and no payment was taken."

### 2.3 Quantity handling

- **Client.**
  - The stepper runs from 1 to `available` (L2642–2668).
  - `available` is parsed from the display string `"<quantity> <unit>"` (L2235–2238) and falls back to 1 if parsing fails.
  - `ReservationRepository.createReservation()` also `require`s quantity > 0.
  - Client values come from the last feed load and may be stale. The server is authoritative.
- **Server (`create_reservation`) rejects:**
  - a quantity ≤ 0;
  - a missing or expired post ("Food post is no longer available");
  - a caller with no profile ("Profile not found");
  - the caller's own post;
  - `status <> 'AVAILABLE'` or `quantity < requested` ("Not enough food available. Only N remains.").
- **Constraint change.** Phase 3 relaxes `food_posts_quantity_check` from `quantity > 0` to `quantity >= 0`, so a fully reserved listing can reach 0.

### 2.4 Atomic quantity protection

- **`create_reservation`** runs everything in one function call, which is one transaction.
  - It row-locks the post (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`), validates, inserts the reservation, and decrements `food_posts.quantity`.
  - The post's `status` becomes `RESERVED` when the quantity reaches 0, otherwise `AVAILABLE`.
  - Concurrent reservations on the same post are serialized by the lock. The later one reads the reduced quantity and fails the check.
- **`cancel_reservation`** locks the reservation row and restores quantity with a single `UPDATE … SET quantity = quantity + n`.
- **`claim_reservation`** locks both the reservation row and the post row.
- **Client permissions.** Clients have **no** INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE grants on `reservations`, only SELECT. Every write goes through the SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
- **Not yet verified.** No concurrency test (two recipients reserving the last units at the same moment) has been run.

### 2.5 Cancellation

- **UI.** Activity → **My Reservations** → open a record → **Cancel**.
  - It is shown only for non-donor records whose status is `Reserved` (`ActivityScreen.kt` L698–699).
- **RPC `cancel_reservation(p_reservation_id)`.**
  - Only the reservation's recipient may cancel.
  - `CLAIMED` or already `CANCELLED` reservations are rejected.
  - It sets the reservation to `CANCELLED`, adds its quantity back to the post, and sets the post's `status = 'AVAILABLE'` unconditionally.
- **After success.** The ViewModel reloads both reservation lists. It does **not** reload the Home feed.

### 2.6 Claiming (the donor marks a reservation as claimed)

- **UI.** Activity → **My Donations** → open a record → **Mark claimed**.
  - It is shown only for donor records whose status is `Reserved` (`ActivityScreen.kt` L696–697).
- **RPC `claim_reservation(p_reservation_id)`.**
  - Only the donor of the reservation's food post may claim, and only a `RESERVED` reservation.
  - It sets the reservation to `CLAIMED`.
  - **It does not change the food post's quantity or status.**
- **Not related:** the Activity **"Claims"** tab is demo data and does not show claimed reservations.

### 2.7 Recipient reservations ("My Reservations")

- **Query.** `ReservationRepository.getMyReservations()` selects from `reservations` where `recipient_id` equals the caller's profile id.
  - This explicit filter matters: RLS alone would also return reservations on the caller's own posts.
- **Joining posts.** Each reservation is matched in memory with its `FoodPost` by `toDisplays()`. It fetches **every** `food_posts` row visible to the caller. Since the 2026-09-25 change (§3.3) it keeps only the posts in `ids` and signs each one's image; before that, `ids` was computed but unused.
- **Visibility.** The recipient can still read a post they reserved after it becomes `RESERVED` with quantity 0. This works through the Phase 3 `food_posts` SELECT policy that uses `is_reservation_recipient()`.
- **Order.** The client does not sort the list.

### 2.8 Donor reservation management ("My Donations")

- **Query.** `ReservationRepository.getReservationsForMyFoodPosts()` calls `get_donor_reservations()`.
  - That SECURITY DEFINER function returns reservations on the caller's own posts, newest first, plus `recipient_name` (`users.name`) only.
  - The same function is defined in `20260924_phase3_donor_recipient_names.sql` and also appended to the end of `20260924_phase3_reservations.sql`. Both use `create or replace`, so running both is harmless.
- **Joining posts.** Rows are matched in memory with the donor's visible `food_posts`; every visible row is fetched. Since the 2026-09-25 change (§3.3), only the posts the rows reference are kept, and each one's image is signed.
- **Display.** The UI shows "Recipient: <name>" on the card and in the details dialog.
  - **Recipient information is limited to the display name.** No email or phone is exposed.

### 2.9 Ownership / security (as implemented)

- **Reservation visibility.** The `reservations` RLS SELECT policy allows the caller when they are the recipient **or** the donor of the reservation's post. There are no write policies or write grants.
- **All four RPCs:**
  - are `SECURITY DEFINER` with `search_path = public`;
  - have `EXECUTE` revoked from `public` and granted to `authenticated`;
  - derive the caller via `current_salusalo_profile_id()` from the JWT.
- **Token check.** `create_reservation`, `cancel_reservation` and `claim_reservation` also check `is_salusalo_firebase_jwt()`. `get_donor_reservations()` and `is_reservation_recipient()` do not; they only filter by the caller's profile.
- **UI rules** mirror the server: no Reserve on your own post, Cancel only on the recipient's `Reserved` records, Mark claimed only on the donor's `Reserved` records. The server is authoritative.
- **Profiles.** `users` RLS is unchanged (users can select only their own row). Recipient names reach donors only through `get_donor_reservations()`.
- **Storage.** `food-images` SELECT is allowed for any authenticated Salu-Salo user (Phase 2 policy). A recipient can therefore create signed URLs for a donor's listing image; the §3.3 change relies on this.
- **Hardening notes** (from reading the SQL; not tested):
  - **Null-unsafe ownership checks.**
    - `cancel_reservation` compares `recipient_id <> v_profile`, and `claim_reservation` compares `v_donor <> current_salusalo_profile_id()`.
    - If the caller has a valid Salu-Salo token but **no** `users` row, that comparison yields NULL, so the ownership check does not raise.
    - `create_reservation` checks `v_profile is null` explicitly; these two do not.
    - Exploiting this requires knowing a reservation UUID, which RLS does not expose to such a caller, so the risk is low.
    - A future migration could use `IS DISTINCT FROM` or an explicit null check.
  - **Donor can edit quantity and status directly.**
    - The `food_posts` UPDATE policy lets a donor change **any** column of their own post, including `quantity` and `status`.
    - So the rule that only the RPCs change quantity is not enforced against the owner.
    - No UI does this today (`updateFoodPost()` is unused), but a future edit-listing feature must account for it.
  - **Silent cascade delete.** Deleting a listing cascade-deletes its reservations, including active ones. The recipient gets no notice.

### 2.10 Food listing quantity / status

- **Quantity.** `food_posts.quantity` is the **remaining** quantity. The originally posted quantity is not stored.
- **Status values.** `AVAILABLE`, `RESERVED`, `CLAIMED`, `EXPIRED` (DB check), mirrored by the `FoodPostStatus` enum.
- **Transitions that actually happen:**

| Event | `quantity` | `status` |
|---|---|---|
| Create listing | As entered. The form requires > 0; the DB allows ≥ 0 after Phase 3. | `AVAILABLE` (required by the insert policy) |
| `create_reservation(n)` | − n | `RESERVED` if it reaches 0, otherwise `AVAILABLE` |
| `cancel_reservation` | + n | `AVAILABLE` (always) |
| `claim_reservation` | unchanged | unchanged |

- **Statuses never set.** `CLAIMED` and `EXPIRED` are **not set by any code path**. Expiry is enforced only by `expiration_date > now()` filters in the feed query and in RLS.
- **Visibility.**
  - The feed shows only `AVAILABLE`, unexpired posts.
  - The donor always sees their own posts in My Listings. After a full reservation that looks like `0 <unit>` with status "Reserved".
  - Other users cannot see a `RESERVED` post unless they hold a reservation on it.

## 3. Phase 3 work items (complete)

Phase 3 was signed off on 2026-09-25. These sections are kept as the record of that work; follow-ups carried forward are listed in §6.

### 3.1 Activity UI separation

**Desired structure**

- **My Reservations**
  - only reservations created by the signed-in recipient
  - Cancel action
- **My Donations / Manage Reservations**
  - only reservations made on the signed-in donor's food posts
  - recipient information
  - Mark Claimed action
- **My Listings**
  - the donor's own food listings

**Handoff description vs. actual code.** The handoff says `myReservations` and `donorReservations` are combined in the same Reservations UI. **The code at `d4f65fe` already keeps them separate.** That commit replaced the old single sample-data "Reservations" tab with separate tabs:

| Desired | Actual code in `ActivityScreen.kt` |
|---|---|
| My Reservations: own reservations only, Cancel | Tab `"My Reservations"`. Data flows `getMyReservations()` (filtered by `recipient_id`) → `ReservationViewModel.myReservations` → `myReservationRecords` (L277–290). Cancel is in the details dialog (L698–699). |
| My Donations / Manage Reservations: reservations on own posts, recipient info, Mark Claimed | Tab `"My Donations"`. Data flows `get_donor_reservations()` → `donorReservations` → `donorReservationRecords` (L293–307). The card shows "Recipient: <name>" (L790–797); Mark claimed is at L696–697. |
| My Listings: own listings | Tab `"My Listings"`. Data flows `getUserFoodPosts()` → `FoodViewModel.myPosts` → `myListingRecords` (L249–274). Delete action. |

- The tab list is at L505–511.
- Sample `"Reservations"` and `"My Listings"` records are filtered out (L310–312). The "Purchases" and "Claims" tabs still show demo data.

**What remains for this item**

1. **Verified on 2026-09-25.** The §4 A/B test passed: B sees the reservation under My Reservations, A does not, and A sees it under My Donations.
2. **Decide the tab label.** It is "My Donations" in code; it could become "Manage Reservations" or "My Donations / Manage Reservations". This is a label-only change.
3. **Related issues seen in the same screen** (not fixed; fix only if in scope):
   - `ActivityScreen` never displays `reservationViewModel.message`, so success **and error** messages from Cancel and Mark claimed are not shown there. The message is not cleared either, so it pops up as a "Reservation" notice the next time any food details dialog opens (`MainActivity.kt` L2279–2287). **Changed in code on 2026-09-25 (§3.4): the Activity screen now shows and clears it. Verified on a device on 2026-09-25 (cancel and claim tests).**
   - The details dialog for reservation records ends with "This is your live Supabase listing." (L686). That text was meant for listings. **Changed in code on 2026-09-25 (§3.5); not built or tested yet.**
   - The reservation lists have no loading or error state.

### 3.2 Recommended for You image

**Status (2026-09-25): verified on a device. The Recommended for You test passed: each card showed its listing's uploaded photo.**
- `RecommendationCard` now takes `imageUrl` (the call site passes `food.imageUrl`). It shows the image with `AsyncImage` and uses the demo drawable only when `imageUrl` is null. If loading fails it shows an "Image unavailable" box, as `AvailableFoodCard` does. The card's size, layout and badge are unchanged.
- `:app:assembleDebug` passes.

**Issue at `d4f65fe` (confirmed in code)**
- `MainActivity.kt` already has the real image URL: `FoodPost.toHomeFood()` (L1970–1988) sets `imageUrl = displayImageUrl` (the signed URL) and `photo = R.drawable.food_produce` (demo).
- The "Recommended for you" row (L1654–1668) passes only `photo = food.photo` to `RecommendationCard`.
- `RecommendationCard` (L2006–2082) draws `Image(painterResource(photo))` (L2027–2034), so it always shows the demo `food_produce` drawable.
- Only the two cards in the horizontal row on the Home page are affected. The "See all" recommendations page uses `AvailableFoodCard`, which already shows real images.

**Desired**
- Display the actual uploaded image: pass `food.imageUrl` into `RecommendationCard` and render it with `AsyncImage`. `coil3.compose.AsyncImage` is already imported in `MainActivity.kt`.
- Use the demo image only as a genuine fallback (no URL).
- Follow the existing `AvailableFoodCard` pattern (L2105–2126): `AsyncImage` with `onError`, the drawable when `imageUrl == null`, and an "Image unavailable" box when loading fails.

### 3.3 Reservation image

**Status (2026-09-25): verified on a device. The §4 A/B test passed, including the uploaded image in both reservation views.**
- `ReservationRepository` now has a private `withSignedImageUrl()`, a copy of `FoodRepository`'s: the same `food-images` bucket and 1-hour signed URL. Both list methods keep only the posts their reservations reference and sign those. `ActivityScreen.kt` is unchanged.
- Since the §3.4 change, both repositories use one shared `withSignedImageUrl(bucket)`, and a failed signature leaves only that post without an image instead of failing the whole list load.
- **Regression found on 2026-09-25 (§3.4):** before that fix, this signing made Account A's My Reservations load fail (A had reservations on two listings whose images are missing), and `refresh()` then skipped My Donations.
- `:app:assembleDebug` passes.

**Issue at `d4f65fe` (confirmed in code)**
- `ReservationRepository.kt` loads the related `FoodPost` rows directly: `getReservationsForMyFoodPosts()` at L40 and `toDisplays()` at L55. It never generates a signed Storage URL for the image.
- `FoodPost.displayImageUrl` is `@Transient` and defaults to null, so reservation records get `uri = null` (`ActivityScreen.kt` L287, L303).
- `RecordPhoto` (L901–935) then draws an **empty** box, with neither an image nor a placeholder. This affects both My Reservations and My Donations.
- `FoodRepository.kt` already has the correct approach in `withSignedImageUrl()` (L102–105): `bucket.createSignedUrl(path, 1.hours)` on the `food-images` bucket, then `copy(displayImageUrl = …)`.

**Desired**
- Use the existing `food-images` bucket and follow the `FoodRepository` signed-URL implementation, keeping the 1-hour expiry.
- Populate `FoodPost.displayImageUrl` before building each `ReservationDisplay`, for both the recipient and donor lists. The existing `RecordPhoto` then shows the actual uploaded image, with its error fallback.
- **Implementation notes:**
  - `withSignedImageUrl()` is `private` in `FoodRepository`. Reuse it via a small shared helper or an equivalent short extension in `ReservationRepository`.
  - Both repository methods currently fetch every visible `food_posts` row. Sign only the posts the reservations actually reference (the unused `ids` set in `toDisplays()`), so there is no Storage call for every listing in the feed.
  - No migration should be needed, because `food-images` read access for authenticated users already exists (Phase 2 policy). This comes from reading the policy; it has not been verified at runtime.

### 3.4 Listings missing from Home / My Listings, and donor reservations not showing

**Status (2026-09-25): code changes made and committed; `assembleDebug` passes. Manually verified on 2026-09-25: the missing-image fallback/feed check passed, and the §4 A/B test passed on this build, and the Activity messages passed in the cancel and claim tests. Not reported: tab reload (§4, §3.4 check 5). The live-database checks below were run by the user on 2026-09-25; the results confirm both causes (see "SQL results").**

**Reported in live tests (2026-09-25)**
- A listing created by Account A appeared in A's My Listings but not on Home, for either account.
- A listing created by Account B appeared neither on Home nor in B's My Listings.
- After B reserved all 8 of A's listing (B's record showed correctly, with its image), A's My Donations was empty.

**Diagnosis**
- Confirmed in code:
  - Each list load signed every post's image, one request at a time, with no per-post error handling. `createSignedUrl` throws when the object is missing or the request times out (supabase-kt 3.5.0, 10 s request timeout), so one bad image failed the whole feed, My Listings or reservation list.
  - On failure the ViewModels kept the previous list. Home showed an error only when its list was empty; Activity showed none.
  - `createFoodPost()` deleted the uploaded image when anything after the upload failed, including signing the row it had already inserted. That can leave a listing whose image no longer exists. While it is `AVAILABLE` and unexpired, it fails every account's feed, and it always fails its owner's My Listings.
  - `createPost()` reloaded the feed before My Listings, so a failed feed reload skipped My Listings. Loads requested while another `FoodViewModel` request ran were silently dropped.
  - `ReservationViewModel.refresh()` loaded My Reservations first; if that failed, My Donations was never requested. Errors went only to `message`, which Activity did not show. The UI does not filter donor records.

**SQL results (run by the user on 2026-09-25; screenshots, not copied here)**
- Check 1: six listings. Two of Account B's listings (both named "lemon dou", quantity 1, created 2026-09-24 06:55 and 07:22 UTC) are `AVAILABLE`, unexpired, and have `image_exists = false`. Every other listing's image exists.
- Check 2: `get_donor_reservations()` exists. The visible part of its result type matches the repo; the rest was cut off in the screenshot.
- Check 3: Account B holds three `RESERVED` reservations on Account A's "glasses" listing (1 + 1 + 8, so it started at 10 and is now `RESERVED` with quantity 0). Account A holds four `CANCELLED` reservations on Account B's "lemon dou" listings.

**Confirmed causes (SQL results plus the code before §3.4)**
- Listings: the two "lemon dou" listings are in every feed and their images cannot be signed, so every feed load failed for both accounts. They are also in B's My Listings, so B's list failed; all of A's listings have images, so A's list loaded.
- Donor reservations: `refresh()` loaded A's My Reservations first. That list includes the four cancelled "lemon dou" reservations, and the §3.3 change signs those listings' images, so the load threw and My Donations was never requested. The donor RPC was not the cause.
- Not confirmed: how the two images disappeared. The app's create cleanup does not fit the first listing (A reserved it about 20 minutes after it was created, which required its image to sign then). The app's delete flow does not fit either, because both rows and their reservations still exist.

**Code changes** (paths relative to `app/src/main/java/com/example/salusalo/`)
- `data/FoodRepository.kt`
  - `withSignedImageUrl(bucket)` is now a shared top-level function. A failed signature leaves only that post's `displayImageUrl` null; coroutine cancellation is still rethrown. The existing null-URL fallback then applies: the demo drawable on Home cards and an empty photo box in Activity.
  - `createFoodPost()` deletes the uploaded image only when the insert itself fails. Decoding and signing run after the try/catch.
- `data/ReservationRepository.kt`: uses the shared `withSignedImageUrl(bucket)`; its private copy is removed.
- `viewmodel/FoodViewModel.kt`
  - `loadAvailablePosts()` and `loadMyPosts()` requested while a request is running are queued and run right after it, one at a time, My Listings first. Each queued load succeeds or fails on its own; `error` keeps the first failure.
  - `createPost()` reloads My Listings, then the feed, as queued loads.
  - `createPost()` and `deletePost()` are still ignored while any request is running (unchanged).
- `viewmodel/ReservationViewModel.kt`: `refresh()`, and the reload after cancel or claim, load My Reservations and My Donations independently and report the first failure through `message`.
- `ActivityScreen.kt`
  - Shows `reservationViewModel.message` in a "Reservation" dialog and clears it, so it no longer appears later in the food details dialog.
  - Tapping the My Reservations or My Donations tab reloads the reservation lists.
- No SQL, RLS, RPC, authentication or storage-policy changes.

### 3.5 Known-issue fixes (after Phase 3 sign-off)

**Status (2026-09-25): changed in code. Not built (the cloud session that made the change has no Android SDK) and not manually tested.** Run `assembleDebug` and the §4 "Checks for the §3.5 fixes" before treating any of it as done.

- **Reservation dialog text** (`ActivityScreen.kt`): the details dialog's closing line now depends on the record. My Listings keeps "This is your live Supabase listing."; My Donations shows "This is a live reservation on your listing."; My Reservations shows "This is your live reservation."
- **Food details** (`MainActivity.kt`, `FoodDetailsScreen`):
  - The header shows the listing's signed image, with the `AvailableFoodCard` fallback: the demo drawable when there is no URL, an "Image unavailable" box when loading fails.
  - The description is the post's own `description` (`HomeFood` now carries it), or "No description provided."
  - "Pickup Address" shows the post's pickup location instead of "Del Rosarrio, Balilihan".
  - Unchanged: allergens ("Not provided — ask the provider", since allergens are not saved), Storage Note, Pickup Window, and the preview-only `FoodActionsDialog`, whose map view still has its own demo address (`FoodActions.kt`).
- **Home feed after cancel** (`ActivityScreen.kt`): when the Activity screen receives the "Reservation cancelled" message, it also calls `foodViewModel.loadAvailablePosts()`, so Home shows the restored quantity. Claim changes neither quantity nor status, so it does not reload the feed. There is still no realtime update across devices.
- **Home greeting** (`MainActivity.kt`, `HomeScreen`): "Good evening, Mika 👋" is replaced by "Good morning / Good afternoon / Good evening, <first name> 👋". The first name is the first word of the Supabase profile name (no name if it is blank). The period uses the device's local time (morning 05:00–11:59, afternoon 12:00–17:59, evening 18:00–04:59) and is re-read every minute while Home is open. The other demo "Mika" values (Profile screen default, preview-only "Requesting as") are unchanged.
- No SQL, RLS, RPC, authentication or storage-policy changes.

**Live-database checks** (read-only; run in the Supabase SQL Editor)

```sql
-- 1. Listings whose image object is missing
select p.created_at, u.name as donor, p.name as listing, p.status, p.quantity,
       p.expiration_date > now() as unexpired, p.image_url, o.id is not null as image_exists
from public.food_posts p
join public.users u on u.id = p.donor_id
left join storage.objects o on o.bucket_id = 'food-images' and o.name = p.image_url
order by p.created_at desc;

-- 2. Does the donor RPC exist, and what does it return?
select p.oid::regprocedure as function, pg_get_function_result(p.oid) as returns
from pg_proc p join pg_namespace n on n.oid = p.pronamespace
where n.nspname = 'public' and p.proname = 'get_donor_reservations';

-- 3. Reservations with their donor and recipient
select r.created_at, r.status, r.quantity, fp.name as listing, d.name as donor, u.name as recipient
from public.reservations r
join public.food_posts fp on fp.id = r.food_post_id
join public.users d on d.id = fp.donor_id
join public.users u on u.id = r.recipient_id
order by r.created_at desc;
```

- **Check 1:** a row with `image_exists = false` is a listing that now loads without its image. If it is `AVAILABLE` and unexpired, it explains the feed failure. Its owner can delete it from My Listings.
- **Check 2:** no row, or a result other than `TABLE(id uuid, food_post_id uuid, recipient_id uuid, quantity integer, status text, created_at timestamp with time zone, updated_at timestamp with time zone, recipient_name text)`, means the existing `supabase/migrations/20260924_phase3_donor_recipient_names.sql` must be run manually in the SQL Editor.
- **Check 3:** B's reservation should list A as the donor.

---

## 4. Manual test: Account A / Account B

### Preconditions (not verifiable from the repo)

- All four migrations are applied to the live Supabase project in order:
  1. `20260921_phase1_foundation.sql`
  2. `20260923_phase2_food_posts.sql`
  3. `20260924_phase3_reservations.sql`
  4. `20260924_phase3_donor_recipient_names.sql`
- Supabase Third-Party Auth is configured for Firebase project `salusalo`, and both accounts receive the `role: authenticated` custom claim.
- A current debug build is installed, with a valid `local.properties` (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`).
- There are two accounts with different emails. Use two devices/emulators, or sign out between steps (Profile → Log out; system Back on the Home page also signs out).
- There is no pull-to-refresh:
  - **Feed:** the Home feed reloads on sign-in, after a reservation, and when leaving Post with its on-screen **Back** button.
  - **Activity:** the Activity tab reloads each time it is opened.

### The test

**Account A:**
- creates a food listing (Post → fill in the required fields → Post Listing)
- quantity = 8
- uploads an image

**Account B:**
- logs in
- reserves all 8 (Home → open A's listing → tap "+" until 8 → Reserve)

**Expected:**
- B sees it under **My Reservations**.
- A does **NOT** see B's reservation under **My Reservations**.
- A sees B's reservation under **My Donations / Manage Reservations** (the tab label in code is "My Donations").
- The uploaded image appears correctly in both relevant views.

**Prediction from the code, not a test result:**
- The first three expectations should pass.
- With the §3.3 change, both reservation cards should show the uploaded image. At `d4f65fe` they rendered none.
- For §3.2, check the Home "Recommended for you" row **before** B reserves all 8. The row shows only the first two posts of the AVAILABLE feed, in no fixed order, and a fully reserved post leaves that feed. Each card in the row should show its listing's uploaded photo, not the demo produce image.

### Optional follow-up checks (for Phase 3 sign-off)

- A → My Listings shows the listing with quantity 0 and status "Reserved", and it is gone from B's feed.
- B cancels: B's record shows "Cancelled", and the listing returns to the feed with 8 available.
- B reserves again, then A taps Mark claimed: both see "Claimed", and B no longer gets a Cancel action.
- With a stale details screen, B requests more than remains: "Not enough food available. Only N remains."
- A opens their own listing: the Reserve button shows "Your listing / You cannot reserve it".

### Checks for the §3.4 fixes

Run the §3.4 SQL checks first, then install a build that contains §3.4.

0. **Existing data (from the 2026-09-25 SQL results):** Home shows five listings for both accounts, and the two "lemon dou" listings use the demo produce photo. A's My Donations shows three `Reserved` records on "glasses" (8, 1, 1) with "Recipient: <B's name>" and the photo. A's My Reservations shows four `Cancelled` "lemon dou" records with no photo. B's My Listings shows all four of B's listings.
1. **Feed with a bad image** (only if check 1 found an `AVAILABLE`, unexpired listing with `image_exists = false`): Home loads for both accounts without "Could not load listings. Try again."; that listing shows the demo produce photo; its owner's My Listings loads.
2. **A's new listing:** A creates a listing with a photo, then taps "Back to home": it is on Home with its photo, and Activity → My Listings shows it. After switching to B, B's Home shows it.
3. **B's new listing:** step 2 with the accounts swapped. Also, right after "Listing published", go straight to Activity with the bottom bar: My Listings shows it.
4. **Donor view:** B reserves all 8 of A's listing. A → Activity → My Donations shows it with "Recipient: <B's name>" and the photo. If a "Reservation" dialog with an error appears instead, record its exact text (see check 2).
5. **Tab reload (two devices):** A keeps Activity open while B reserves, then taps My Donations: the new reservation appears.
6. **Messages:** A taps Mark claimed: a "Reservation" dialog on Activity says "Reservation marked as claimed." After OK, opening any listing on Home shows no leftover notice. Same for B → Cancel ("Reservation cancelled. The quantity is available again.").

### Checks for the §3.5 fixes

1. **Food details:** open a listing that has a photo and a description. The header shows the uploaded photo, the text is the listing's description, and "Pickup Address" is its pickup location. A listing without a description shows "No description provided."
2. **Missing image:** open one of the "lemon dou" listings (image missing from Storage). The header shows the demo produce photo.
3. **Dialog text:** in Activity, open one record per tab. My Listings ends with "This is your live Supabase listing.", My Reservations with "This is your live reservation.", My Donations with "This is a live reservation on your listing."
4. **Feed after cancel:** B reserves part of A's listing, cancels it in Activity → My Reservations, then goes to Home with the bottom bar. The listing shows the restored quantity (and is back on the feed if B had reserved all of it).
5. **Greeting:** sign in as A: Home says "Good morning/afternoon/evening, <A's first name> 👋" matching the device time. Sign in as B: it shows B's first name.

### Phase 4 test: messaging and alerts (Account A / Account B)

Preconditions: `20260926_phase4_messaging_notifications.sql` has been run in the SQL Editor, `messages` and `notifications` appear under Database → Publications → `supabase_realtime`, and a build with Phase 4 is installed. Two devices make the live parts visible; with one device, sign out between steps and check the result after signing in.

1. **Start a chat:** B opens A's listing → "Message Donor" → sends "Is this still available?". A (Home open) sees the chat icon badge and the bell badge increase without refreshing; Home → chat icon lists the thread with B's name, the listing and an unread count.
2. **Live reply:** A opens the thread and replies. B, with the chat open, sees the reply appear without refreshing. A's thread shows no unread count after opening.
3. **Prefilled questions:** B taps the Allergens row on A's listing: the chat opens with "Hi! What allergens does <listing> contain?" in the input.
4. **Own listing:** A opens their own listing: the button reads "Your listing", and tapping it (or Allergens/Storage) shows "You cannot message yourself…".
5. **Reservation alerts:** B reserves part of A's listing → A gets "New reservation" in Alerts. B cancels → A gets "Reservation cancelled". B reserves again and A marks it claimed → B gets "Reservation claimed". Tapping a reservation alert opens Activity on My Donations (A) or My Reservations (B).
6. **Chat from Activity:** A → Activity → My Donations → record → "Message recipient", and B → My Reservations → record → "Message donor": both land in the same thread as step 1.
7. **Preferences:** A → Profile → Preferences → Notifications → turns off "New messages" → Save ("Preferences saved to your account."). B sends a message: it arrives in A's chat, but A gets no new MESSAGE alert. Turn it back on afterwards. The same switches are in Alerts → settings icon.
8. **Mark read:** Alerts → "Mark shown as read": the unread count and the bell badge go to 0 and stay 0 after reopening the app.
9. **Token refresh:** leave the app open on Home for more than an hour, then have the other account send a message: it still arrives live. (Realtime is re-authenticated every 5 minutes; §8.3.)
10. **Regression:** because the Ktor engine changed to OkHttp, repeat the Phase 1/2 regression and the A/B reservation test above.

### Results log

| Date | Build / commit | Tester | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-25 | `d4f65fe` + uncommitted §3.2–§3.4 changes | Developer | Passed | Phase 1: authentication/profile regression (reported as one result). |
| 2026-09-25 | same | Developer | Passed | Phase 2, Account A: Home/feed, create listing, delete listing. |
| 2026-09-25 | same | Developer | Passed | Phase 2, Account B: Home/feed, create listing, delete listing. |
| 2026-09-25 | same | Developer | Passed | Phase 3: the A/B reservation test ("The test" above). |
| 2026-09-25 | same | Developer | Passed | Phase 3: missing-image fallback/feed (check 1 in "Checks for the §3.4 fixes"). |
| 2026-09-25 | same (no code changes since 10:04) | Developer | Passed | Phase 3: cancel (Account B). A "Reservation" dialog on Activity showed "Reservation cancelled. The quantity is available again."; the record then showed Cancelled with no Cancel button; no leftover popup on Home. |
| 2026-09-25 | same | Developer | Passed | Phase 3: mark claimed (Account A). A "Reservation" dialog on Activity showed "Reservation marked as claimed."; the record then showed Claimed with no Mark claimed button; B saw Claimed with no Cancel button; no leftover popup on Home. |
| 2026-09-25 | same | Developer | Passed | Phase 3: Recommended for You image. Each card showed its listing's uploaded photo, matching the "Available near you" list. |

- **Build:** the test phone's app code was deployed on 2026-09-25 at 10:37 (+08:00), after the last source change (10:04), so it matches the working tree above. That same code was committed on 2026-09-25, with no source changes after 10:04. The build on any second device was not checked.
- **Phase 3 sign-off:** on 2026-09-25 the developer declared Phases 1–3 complete and manually verified. The cancel, claim and Recommended for You tests were then run and passed (rows above). These checks still have no individual test record:
  - from the optional follow-up checks above: the fully reserved listing in My Listings, a cancelled listing's return to the feed, over-quantity, and reserving your own listing;
  - §3.4 check 5 (tab reload) and the bottom-bar step in check 3;
  - the concurrency and negative ownership tests (§2.11).

## 6. Development order

### Phase 3 (complete, signed off on 2026-09-25)

1. **Separate My Reservations and My Donations / Manage Reservations.** The code at `d4f65fe` already separates them (§3.1). **Verified on 2026-09-25** (§4 A/B test). The tab label decision is still open.
2. **Fix the Recommended for You image** (§3.2). Code changed on 2026-09-25. **Verified on 2026-09-25** (Recommended for You test).
3. **Fix the Reservation image** (§3.3). Code changed on 2026-09-25. **Verified on 2026-09-25** (§4 A/B test).
4. **Build the project** (`assembleDebug`). Passed on 2026-09-25 after steps 2 and 3, and again after the §3.4 load-failure fixes.
5. **Manually test with two accounts** (§4), including the §3.4 checks, and record the outcome in the results log. The §3.4 SQL checks were run on 2026-09-25. **On 2026-09-25** the A/B reservation test and the missing-image fallback/feed check passed. Not reported: the items listed under the results log.
6. **Regression-test Phase 1/2:**
   - sign-up (creates the profile), sign-in, sign-out, password-reset email;
   - create a listing with an image and see it in the feed and in My Listings;
   - delete a listing, which also deletes its image.
   - **Passed on 2026-09-25, as reported:** authentication/profile regression; Home/feed, create listing and delete listing for both accounts.
7. **Phase 3 signed off as complete by the developer on 2026-09-25.** Carried forward, not blocking:
   - The checks without an individual test record (listed under the results log, §4).
   - The tab label decision (§3.1).
   - How the two "lemon dou" images went missing (§3.4).
8. **Commit the work since `d4f65fe`.** Done on 2026-09-25: the §3.2–§3.4 code changes, `docs/` and `CLAUDE.md`.

### Phase 4 — Messaging and Notifications (in progress)

Started on 2026-09-25 at the developer's request; scope and status are in §8. Remaining steps:

1. Apply `supabase/migrations/20260926_phase4_messaging_notifications.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor and check the Realtime publication.
2. Build with `assembleDebug` (not possible in the cloud session that wrote the code).
3. Run the Phase 4 test in §4 and the regression, and record the results in the results log.
4. Sign off Phase 4.

Phase 5 (Maps, Reviews, Reports) and Phase 6 (Admin and Final Release) follow; neither has started.

---

## 7. Other observations (not scheduled; verify before acting)

- **Food details screen.** The `FoodDetailsScreen` header shows the demo drawable (`MainActivity.kt` L2333–2338), not the uploaded image. Its description, allergens and "Pickup Address" are canned text (L2288–2314, L2560) rather than the post's data. **Header image, description and pickup address changed in code on 2026-09-25 (§3.5); not built or tested yet.** Allergens stay generic because they are not saved.
- **Dropped requests.** Since §3.4, feed and My Listings loads requested during another `FoodViewModel` request are queued, not dropped. Still ignored while any request is running: `FoodViewModel.createPost()`/`deletePost()`, and every `ReservationViewModel` request (for example a tab-tap reload during a running refresh).
- **No refresh after cancel or claim.** The Home feed does not reload after either action, and there is no realtime update across devices. **Reload after cancel added in code on 2026-09-25 (§3.5); not built or tested yet.** Claim does not change the feed; realtime updates are still missing.
- **Placeholder or hard-coded UI values:**
  - the greeting "Good evening, Mika". **Changed in code on 2026-09-25 (§3.5): it now uses the signed-in profile's first name and the time of day. Not built or tested yet.**
  - the location "Del Rosarrio, Balilihan";
  - "Browse all 10 food listings";
  - Activity metrics 48 / 128;
  - sample Purchases, Claims and reviews (sample Alerts were replaced by real alerts in Phase 4);
  - "Nearby" and "For Sale" filters that rely on fixed distance and price values.
- **Read access after cancel.** `is_reservation_recipient()` ignores reservation status, so a recipient keeps read access to a post after cancelling.
- **Signed URL expiry.** Signed image URLs expire after 1 hour and are not refreshed while a screen stays open.
- **Raw error messages.** User-facing errors are raw exception messages from supabase-kt and Firebase. How readable the RPC error text is has not been checked.

---

## 8. Phase 4 — Messaging and Notifications

**Status (2026-09-25): implemented in code, not built with AGP, migration not applied to the live project, not tested on a device.** Scope chosen by the developer: chat per listing; in-app alerts only (no push); live updates with Supabase Realtime; notification preferences stored in Supabase.

### 8.1 Database (`supabase/migrations/20260926_phase4_messaging_notifications.sql`)

- **`conversations`**: one thread per `(food_post_id, recipient_id)`; `donor_id` is copied from the listing by the RPCs. Per-side read times (`recipient_last_read_at`, `donor_last_read_at`) and `last_message_at`. Deleted with the listing (cascade).
- **`messages`**: `conversation_id`, `sender_id`, `body` (1–2000 characters after trimming), `created_at`.
- **`notifications`**: per-user alerts of type `MESSAGE`, `RESERVATION_CREATED`, `RESERVATION_CANCELLED` or `RESERVATION_CLAIMED`, with optional links to the listing, conversation and reservation, and `read_at`.
- **`notification_preferences`**: one row per user (`message_alerts`, `reservation_alerts`, `recommendations`, `pickup_reminders`). A missing row means everything is on. Only `message_alerts` and `reservation_alerts` affect alerts today.
- **Access:** clients may only SELECT conversations and messages they take part in, and their own alerts and preferences. `notification_preferences` also allows INSERT/UPDATE of the caller's own row. Every other write goes through SECURITY DEFINER functions that take the caller from the JWT:
  - `start_listing_conversation(p_food_post_id)`: get or create the caller's thread with the donor. Rejects the caller's own listing, and listings that are not available unless the caller has a reservation on them.
  - `open_reservation_conversation(p_reservation_id)`: get or create the thread of a reservation; either its recipient or the listing's donor may call it.
  - `send_message(p_conversation_id, p_body)`: participants only; also updates the thread and alerts the other participant.
  - `mark_conversation_read(p_conversation_id)`: also marks that thread's message alerts read.
  - `mark_notifications_read(p_ids)`: the caller's alerts; `null` marks all.
  - `get_my_conversations(p_conversation_id)`: the caller's threads with the listing name and image path, the other participant's **display name only**, the last message and the unread count.
- **Alerts** are created only by the database: `notify_user()` (not executable by clients) respects the preferences, and a trigger on `reservations` alerts the donor when a reservation is created or cancelled and the recipient when it is claimed. The Phase 3 RPCs are unchanged.
- **Realtime:** `messages` and `notifications` are added to the `supabase_realtime` publication; Realtime applies the SELECT policies to what each client receives.

### 8.2 Privacy change

Before Phase 4, recipients never saw the donor's name. In a conversation, **both participants see each other's display name** (through `get_my_conversations()`), never email or phone. `users` RLS is unchanged.

### 8.3 App

- **Dependencies:** `realtime-kt` added; the Ktor engine changed from `ktor-client-android` to `ktor-client-okhttp` (the Android engine has no WebSocket support) and Ktor aligned to 3.4.2, the version supabase-kt 3.5.0 uses.
- **Realtime auth:** Realtime uses the same Firebase ID token as PostgREST (the client's `accessToken` lambda), read when a channel joins. Without the Supabase Auth plugin it is never refreshed automatically, so `NotificationViewModel` calls `realtime.setAuth()` every 5 minutes (confirmed by reading the realtime-kt 3.5.0 sources; the refresh itself is untested).
- **Data layer:** `MessageRepository`, `NotificationRepository`, `realtimeInserts()` (a channel per stream, removed when collection stops), `MessageViewModel` and `NotificationViewModel` (created per profile like the Phase 3 ViewModels and cleared on sign-out). `signedUrlOrNull()` is shared with `withSignedImageUrl()`.
- **UI:**
  - Home header: new chat icon (badge = unread message alerts) → Messages inbox (`MessagesScreen`); bell badge = all unread alerts.
  - `ChatScreen`: full-screen conversation over any screen, live updates, marks the thread read.
  - Food details: "Message Donor", the Allergens and Storage rows, and the details dialog's "Ask for exact location"/"Message provider" links open the real chat (prefilled where the demo chat was). On your own listing the button reads "Your listing".
  - Activity: "Message donor"/"Message recipient" in reservation details; the bell dot only shows with unread alerts.
  - Alerts: real alerts, filters All/Messages/Reservations, Today/Earlier, mark read, tap to open the chat or the Activity tab, settings dialog saved to Supabase. The sample alerts and the "Personalized for you" card were removed.
  - Profile → Preferences → Notifications: "New messages", "Reservation updates", "Food recommendations" and "Pickup reminders" are saved to Supabase; "Notification sound" stays on the device.

### 8.4 Known limits

- No push notifications (the app must be open for live updates; alerts are still stored and shown later).
- No blocking or reporting of users (Phase 5), and no editing or deleting of messages.
- No rate limit on messages beyond the 2000-character limit.
- Deleting a listing deletes its conversations, messages and related alerts.
- The chat icon badge counts unread message **alerts**, so it stays empty when message alerts are turned off; the inbox still shows unread counts.
- The Profile screen's bell still opens settings and always shows its dot (unchanged demo UI).

### 8.6 How the Phase 4 code was checked (2026-09-25)

The cloud session that wrote Phase 4 has no Android SDK, and Google's Maven repository is blocked there, so no AGP build was possible.
- **SQL:** all five migrations were run in order on a local PostgreSQL 16 with stand-ins for Supabase's `auth.jwt()`, roles, Storage tables and the `supabase_realtime` publication; the Phase 4 file was then re-run without errors. A test with three accounts (A donor, B recipient, C outsider) confirmed: starting a thread and messaging; unread counts and read marking; MESSAGE and reservation alerts (created, cancelled, claimed); the same thread from the listing and from the reservation; the preference switch suppressing message alerts; the preferences upsert; and the denials (messaging your own listing, direct inserts into `messages`/`notifications`, calling `notify_user`, a non-participant reading, sending or opening a thread, writing another user's preferences, calls without a valid token).
- **Kotlin:** every app source file was compiled with kotlinc 2.2.10 plus the Compose and serialization compiler plugins, against the real supabase-kt 3.5.0 JVM jars and Compose Multiplatform desktop jars, with small stand-ins for Android, AndroidX Activity/Lifecycle and Firebase APIs. It compiled with no errors and no warnings in the new code. This checks types and API usage only; it is not an Android build.
